            <p>Hey there, my name is Blair Brownlie-Edward and I'm a web/software developer! I was born in
                England to Scottish parents and moved to the United States when I was about three years old, and I've
                called
                Arizona home ever since then.</p>

            <p>So far my main focus has been in growing my skills as a full-stack javascript developer. You can check
                out some of my projects in my portfolio section! Right now my
                favorite technologies and libraries include Bootstrap, handlebars, node, express, Mysql, and MongoDB
                Although I'm always looking for my next opportunity to learn something new, and hope to begin mastering
                React soon!</p>

            <p>When I'm not buried knee-deep in some code, you can usually find me playing music on my guitar or outside
                playing soccer with my friends! But enough about me, and more about everything I've worked on, click <a
